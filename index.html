    <h1>Tetris</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to use Python object-oriented programming to 
        create a classic game of one of the most addictive games ever created, Tetris.
    </p>

    <h3>Instruction</h3>
    <p>Tetris is played by arranging a sequence of shapes into complete lines. As each
        line is completed, it will disappear from the screen. The pieces fall from the top
        of the screen to the bottom. Each piece is made up of four blocks, arranged into 
        seven different patterns. As the pieces fall, rotate them using the up and down arrow 
        keys and move them using the left and right arrow keys to create lines. If you cannot 
        complete a line, the blocks will eventually stack up and rise to the top of the screen 
        and the game will end!
