    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p> Tetris is played by arranging a sequence of shapes into complete rows. As each
        row is completed, it will disappear from the screen. The pieces fall from the top
        of the screen to the bottom. Each piece is made up of four blocks, arranged into 
        seven different patterns. You can rotate, move and drop the pieces as they fall to create rows.
        But watch out! The pieces begin to fall faster every time you clear ten rows.
        And if the blocks stack up and rise to the top of the screen, it's game over.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Controls</h2>
    Left Arrow: Move piece to the left.<br>
    Right Arrow: Move piece to the right.<br>
    Up Arrow: Rotate piece clockwise.<br>
    Down Arrow: Rotate piece counter-clockwise.<br>
    Z Key: Drop the piece more quickly.<br>
    Space Key: Drop the piece immediately.

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    Clearing one row: 100 points + 10 points per level<br>
    Clearing four rows at once: 600 points + 500 per level<br>
    Dropping a piece more quickly: 2 points for every row dropped + 0.5 points per level<br>
    Dropping a piece immediately: 5 points for every row dropped + 2.5 points per level
